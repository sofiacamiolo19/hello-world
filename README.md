# hello-world
A little repository
I'm Sof√≠a from Argentina and I'm here because I want to practice and improve my coding skills. I have just begun with Html, Css and JavaScript.
I'd like coding with Php and someday become a full-stack developer.
But well, for now, I'm just looking for the next step...
